#   library_dirs
#       List of directories to add to the library search path when compiling
#       extensions with this dependency. Use the character given by os.pathsep
#       to separate the items in the list. On UN*X-type systems (Linux, FreeBSD,
#       OS X):

#
#   include_dirs
#       List of directories to add to the header file earch path.
#           include_dirs = /usr/include:/usr/local/include
#
# All libraries used **must** be dynamic.
